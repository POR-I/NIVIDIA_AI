# **Fitness Equipment Identification by Using YoloV5**

---

## **Background information**

---

<aside>
**This project aims to build a system that uses a YOLOv5-based object recognition model to identify fitness accessories in real-time and provide their names, helping customers quickly recognize the correct names and purposes of these items. When customers present various accessories in front of the camera, the system recognizes them and immediately provides the name and purpose of each tool. Through this, customers can learn more about exercise equipment, increase their workout efficiency, and learn the correct ways to use the tools.**

</aside>

# **General description of the current project**

---

<aside>
**Various accessories are used during exercise, but many customers often fail to accurately recognize the names of these accessories. Different tools such as kettlebells, yoga blocks, lacrosse balls, and foam rollers each play important roles in specific exercises. However, people frequently don't know or confuse the exact names of these tools. As a result, customers experience confusion about which tools to use during workouts and how to utilize them. Additionally, not knowing the names often leads to the need for additional searches to find proper information or wasted time in selecting the right tool. To prevent this, we provide real-time recognition of accessories and practical training information.**

</aside>

# **Proposed idea for enhancements to the project**

---

- **Efficient learning: Customers can obtain real-time information about tools without direct searching, increasing the speed of learning**
- **Enhanced user experience: Providing an environment where users can focus on exercising without confusion by instantly recognizing tools used during workouts**
- **Maximizing exercise effectiveness: Ability to use the correct tools accurately, maximizing exercise effects and reducing the risk of injury**
- **Integration of technology and exercise: Providing a smarter exercise experience by offering an environment where users can exercise and learn simultaneously using the latest AI technologyIn fact, places like PT shops provide sufficient competitiveness and convenience as the visual aspect and service provision are important**
    
    (**In fact, places like PT shops offer enough competitiveness and convenience for what they see and what they serve to be important)**
    

- **Strengthening communication between trainers and clients: Trainers can help clients use tools correctly, and through this system, provide better feedback through smooth communication with clients**

# **Value and significance of the project**

---

<aside>
**This project is an AI system that recognizes fitness accessories in real-time and provides their names and usage instructions. Many customers may learn inefficiently or risk injury due to lack of knowledge about the names or proper use of exercise equipment.**

**This system aims to solve this issue by helping customers quickly and accurately recognize tools, maximizing exercise effectiveness and preventing injuries. By utilizing YOLOv5 to recognize tools in real-time, it facilitates smoother communication between trainers and customers, providing a safer and more efficient exercise environment.**

</aside>

# **Current limitations**

---

<aside>
**This system provides real-time recognition of fitness accessories and personalized exercise tracking information, but there are limitations in perfectly personalizing all exercises. Due to the variety in design, color, and size depending on the brand or manufacturer of accessories, there may be cases where even identical tools are difficult to recognize. This presents a realistic challenge in achieving perfect recognition due to the varied forms and color differences of diverse accessories. However, we aim for gradually higher recognition rates through continuous improvements.**

</aside>

# **Literature review**

---

<aside>
**1. A thorough understanding of the technical background of this project is required through prior research on the limitations of cameras in recognizing multiple objects simultaneously and on object detection and tracking technologies using YOLOv5.**

**2. A comprehensive understanding of image recognition, object detection, and classification is necessary, supported by diverse training datasets and AI learning for recognizing various fitness accessories.**

# **How to Extract a Video into Images and .txt Files**

**Open the video and select the file to extract.**
![v1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f24b988-e62e-4acb-9404-49c37d3e14e5)


**Make sure you open the video and create a folder to store the image you want to extract and create more images folders in the folder you created to distinguish it from the notated .txt file**

**Check the box + label and label it according to the name of each accessory
When labeling, Box + Label is selected to distinguish the screen during labeling.

After all labeling, press the as images button in the pre-saved folder images folder to save it in the form of an image.**

# Learning Yolov5 with Colab

---

### **1.** Connect to Colab and connect to Google Drive to create subfolders

```python
# prompt: Íµ¨Í∏Ä ÎìúÎùºÏù¥Î∏åÎûë Ïó∞Í≤∞

from google.colab import drive
drive.flush_and_unmount()  # Í∏∞Ï°¥ ÎßàÏö¥Ìä∏ Ìï¥Ï†ú
drive.mount('/content/drive')  # Îã§Ïãú ÎßàÏö¥Ìä∏
```

```python
%cd /content/drive/MyDri
```

```python
# prompt: Íµ¨Í∏Ä ÎìúÎùºÏù¥Î∏åÎûë Ïó∞Í≤∞

from google.colab import drive
drive.flush_and_unmount()  # Í∏∞Ï°¥ ÎßàÏö¥Ìä∏ Ìï¥Ï†ú

### **2. Download YOLOv5**

```python
##
#clone YOLOv5 and
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone repo
%cd yolov5
%pip install -qr requirements.txt # install dependencies
```

```python
!pip install Pillow==10.3
```

**YOLOv5 downloads pip, a tool that makes it easy to install and manage Python packages, and Pillow Library, which is responsible for image processing.**

![v13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829fb87b-00e5-45f6-a7e9-81775dd1f201)

### **3.** Create a management folder for image files

```python
!mkdir -p Train/labels
!mkdir -p Train/images
!mkdir -p Val/labels
!mkdir -p Val/images
%pw
```

```python

# Ïã§Ìñâ
train_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/yolov5/Train'
val_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/yolov5/Val'

create_validation_set(train_path, val_path)
```

**The validation dataset is composed by extracting images from the training data at a specified rate, separating and copying them into validation data, and copying the label file along with the image to the corresponding path. The functions of the code are as follows.**

- **Evaluation of the performance of the model**
    - **Validation data is data that the model has not learned, and is needed to evaluate the generalization performance of the model (how well it works on new data**
- **Data bias prevention**
    - **Using only the training data is likely to overfit the model to the data.**
    - **You can check the model to have balanced performance for various data**
- **Hyperparameter tuning**
    - **When adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and model structure during learning, refer to the results of validation data and optimize the hyperparameters in the direction of increasing validation performance.**
    

**Isolation of validation data is an essential process for performance evaluation and improvement of the model.**

```python
def check_dataset():
    train_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/yolov5/Train'
    val_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/yolov5/Val'

    # Train Îç∞Ïù¥ÌÑ∞ ÌôïÏù∏
    train_images = len(os.listdir(os.path.join(train_path, 'images')))
    train_labels = len(os.listdir(os.path.join(train_path, 'labels')))

    # Val Îç∞Ïù¥ÌÑ∞ ÌôïÏù∏
    val_images = len(os.listdir(os.path.join(val_path, 'images')))
    val_labels = len(os.listdir(os.path.join(val_path, 'labels')))

    print("Dataset status:")
    print(f"Train - Images: {train_images}, Labels: {train_labels}")
    print(f"Val - Images: {val_images}, Labels: {val_labels}")

# Îç∞Ïù¥ÌÑ∞ÏÖã ÏÉÅÌÉú ÌôïÏù∏
check_dataset()
```

![v7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d81273f-6017-4dae-a7f4-084e55c05ddb)

If the size of the dataset differs to the extent that there is no significant difference between a few tens and a few hundred chapters as follows, there is no big problem in learning afterwards. The accuracy will be slightly lowered, but it does not significantly affect the current number of original images.
